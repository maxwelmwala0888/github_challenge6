What I Built
I built a Real Estate Project Showcase Application designed to help property developers and real estate businesses present their work in a clear, organized, and visually engaging way.
The application allows users to explore different real estate developments by category, including:
•	In-progress projects – to show ongoing construction and upcoming properties.
•	Completed projects – to highlight finished developments and demonstrate credibility.
•	Client reviews and testimonials – to build trust through real customer feedback.
The goal of this application is to create a simple but professional platform where potential buyers, investors, or partners can easily view projects, track progress, and see the quality of completed work.
To me, this project represents more than just a portfolio website — it’s a practical digital solution that improves how real estate businesses communicate their work and reputation to the public.
Demo
The application provides a clean interface where users can browse real estate projects and view important details such as project status, descriptions, and visual updates.
Key features demonstrated in the app:
•	Project listing with status indicators (In Progress / Completed)
•	Visual presentation of property developments
•	Dedicated section for client testimonials and reviews
•	Organized layout for easy navigation
